A modern, retro-styled chiptune Snake game built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Developed by Eduardo and Alessandro.  🐍 Features 1 or 2 Player Modes: Play solo or compete head-to-head. Retro Arcade Aesthetics: Dynamic neon visuals, CRT-style scanlines, and chiptune music. Dynamic Food System: White Food: Grow your snake and increase your score. Red Food: Appears occasionally. Eating it will halve your snake's length and score (be careful!). Food Expiry: Food doesn't stay forever. It blinks before disappearing and respawning elsewhere. Speed Progression: The game gets faster as you eat more food or maintain streaks. Advanced 2P Mechanics: Ghost Mode: Collision with an opponent's body (not head) briefly turns you into a ghost, allowing you to pass through safely at the cost of some length. Head-to-Head: A perfect head-on collision results in a Draw. Win Condition: First to 200 points wins. Customizable Board: Choose your preferred grid size and starting speed in the setup menu. 🎮 Controls Global Spacebar: Start Game (Menu) / Restart Game (Game Over) P: Pause / Resume R: Restart Round M: Toggle Music & SFX Player 1 Arrow Keys: Move Up, Down, Left, Right Player 2 W, A, S, D: Move Up, Down, Left, Right 🛠️ Tech Stack HTML5 Canvas for rendering.
